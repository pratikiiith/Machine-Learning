Q1.K-Nearest Neighbors
      1. Implement a KNN based classifier to predict digits from images of handwritten
      digits in the dataset.
      2. Featurize the images as vectors that can be used for classification.
      3. Experiment with different values of K(number of neighbors).
      4. Experiment with different distance measures - Euclidean distance, Manhattan dis-
      tance,
      5. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
      useful.
      6. Implement baselines such as random guessing/majority voting and compare perfor-
      mance. Also, report the performance of scikit-learn’s kNN classifier. Report your
      findings.
      
Q2. K-Nearest Neighbors
      1. Implement a KNN based classifier to classify given set of features in Mushroom
      Database. Missing data must be handled appropriately.(Denoted by ”?”).
      2. Choose an appropriate distance measure for categorical features.
      3. Experiment with different values of K(number of neighbors).
      4. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
      useful.
      5. Implement baselines such as random guessing/majority voting and compare perfor-
      mance. Also, report the performance of scikit-learn’s kNN classifier. Report your
      findings.
      
Q3. Decision Tree
      1. Implement a decision tree to predict housing prices for the given dataset using the
      available features.
      2. The various attributes of the data are explained in the file data description.txt.
      Note that some attributes are categorical while others are continuos.
      3. Feel Free to use Python libraries such as binarytree or any other library in Python
      to implement the binary tree. However, you cannot use libraries like scikit-learn
      which automatically create the decision tree for you.
      4. Use variance reduction as the criterion for choosing the split in the decision tree.
      Experiment with different approaches to decide when to terminate the tree.
      5. Report metrics such as Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
      along with any other metrics that you feel may be useful.
      6. For feature engineering, you may consider normalizing/standardizing the data.SMAI (CSE/ECE 478)
      7. Implement simple baselines such as always predicting the mean/median of the train-
      ing data. Also, compare the performance against scikit-learn’s decision tree. Report
      your findings.
